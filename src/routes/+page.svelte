    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website. I reccommend using a dekstop to view it. It's made to keep my art and 
        ramblings and whatever else I choose to put on it. Your problems are not my own and I can think for myself.
        I will not abide by your statements unless I agree with them.

        The guy in the bottom left was originally going to be a "return to top" button but I don't think that'd really
        be an issue. He's going to stay though because I love him. He's my first born son and his name is Reid. I draw
        portraits of him a lot. In fact it's almost all I draw but I'm trying to get better at drawing fullbodies and 
        stuff. Yay. Regardless there's probably going to be a lot of art of him. 
        <br>

        Also ignore the "barren" sidebar I have no idea what else to put there aside from navigation... I'll decide
        soon though just gimmie a minute!

                The version you see now is by no means final, and is only up for testing purposes. This is the only
