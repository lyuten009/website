    <p>
        Hello and welcome to my website. It's perpetually under construction. It should
        work, display, and function properly on phones but I can't promise
        anything...
        I'd say it's best viewed in a Chromium browser but Firefox should be ok too.
        <br>
        Also fuck tablet users you don't get anything special. (Use landscape mode)
        <br>
        Thank you for visiting and enjoy your stay! (or don't)
    </p>

            I don't have anything to put here really BUT this skeleton looks pretty cool.
            It is a... uh... "Euarchontoglire", which is the group where Treeshrews, Colugos,
            Primates, and Glires come together. I've been looking at the recently for
            worldbuilding purposes because I'm actually awesome and super cool.
            Originally I had one of the sophonts descend from rabbits but then I remembered
            that I don't want people to think I'm a furry so I went with making them weird
            Euarchontoglire descendants instead. Because then I can say they're close enough
            to monkies or something. I also wanted them to have canines. As in canine teeth.
            Because canine teeth are pretty awesome yk. Canine teeth as in the canines not as
            in dogs. I also can't really get this to float how I want it to float so that's also
            why it's here. For testing purposes. Yay. They're euthanising me on Wednesday.
